# Photon Vision's Note Detection, April Tag Detection, and Robot Position Estimator 
This code is indended to be used alongside Photon Vision. Photon Vision will take frames from a connected camera, check whether certain objects are in the frame, and send the information about these objects to Network Tables. By pulling this information down using PhotonLibPy, we can run PhotonPoseEstimator to figure out the location of objects and the robot.
## Steps to start Photon Vision
1. Install a Jar file from [this release page]([url](https://github.com/PhotonVision/photonvision/releases)).
   - I recommend version [2024.3.1]([url](https://github.com/PhotonVision/photonvision/releases)) as it is not a beta and works the best.
2. Install [PhotonLibPy]([url](https://pypi.org/project/photonlibpy/)) using ```pip install PhotonLibPy``` or ```pip3 install PhotonLibPy```
3. Run the Jar file by navigating to the directory of the file in your Terminal and run ```java -jar C:\path\to\photonvision\NAME OF JAR FILE GOES HERE.jar```
   - For example, if you ran my recommended version of PhotonLib, the command would be  ```java -jar photonvision-v2024.3.1-winx64.jar```6
4. Once the Jar file is running (meaning the backend of the UI is running), navigate to ```localhost:5800``` in order to view the UI.

**_NOTE:_**  If you are using an operating system that is not Windows, these steps may vary, so navigate to [Software Installation]([url](https://docs.photonvision.org/en/latest/docs/advanced-installation/sw_install/index.html)) to see all other ways of installation
